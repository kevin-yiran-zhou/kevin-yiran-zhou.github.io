Hello and welcome to my webpage!

I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Robotics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I work as a lab assistant in the **[BioElectronic Vision Lab](https://weilandresearch.bme.umich.edu/)** under Professor James Weiland. My primary project involves developing smart glasses for individuals with blindness and low vision. My research interests focus on leveraging robotics and AI to help people with disabilities.

Previously, I earned my Bachelor's degree from New York University in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science. During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a research assistant in the **[VMIL/REACTIV Lab](https://rizz0lab.wordpress.com/)** led by Professor John Ross Rizzo, where I contributed to the UNav project for enhancing mobility for individuals with blindness and low vision.

On my webpage, you can explore the work I've done, including my academic projects and research. I hope you find the content insightful and informative. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect!
